I have yet to build this section of the website. For questions or inquiries about book folding commissions, please email me at coopershapard@duck.com!

**I also donate 20% of all book folding profits directly to [Readers 2 Leaders](https://www.readers2leaders.org/), a Dallas-centered nonprofit that equips students for success through the power of reading.**

If you have another book/reading-based charity you would like me to donate to, please include it in your order and I will donate to them instead[^charity]!

[^charity]: If a tax-report analysis shows the charity is reputable.
