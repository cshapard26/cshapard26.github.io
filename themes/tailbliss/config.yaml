      - text: "Originally built to manage Clippy2 files for Plover, it was later extended to support custom dictionaries, phoneticize results, and use a fine-tuned GPT model to generate custom briefs."
      - text: "Useful for both beginning and advanced stenographers to help improve speed and reduce the toil of brief creation and memorization."

By using technologies such as Zero-Knowledge Proofs, One-Time Keys, and Commit-and-Reveal protocol, it ensures attribution of traded data and allows users to choose exactly who can and cannot touch the data they share."
      - text: "The project is currently in development, and I am working alongside 2 PhD students and 1 post-doctorate student to bring Membrane to the world. A paper with our methods is currently underway to be published in a conference hosted by IEEE."

    url: /bookfolding
    content:
      - text: "Book folding is the art of cutting and folding the pages of a book to bring out a three-dimensional image, and it is one of my favorite hobbies. They say a picture is worth a thousand words, so why not turn a thousand words into a picture?"
      - text: "The process is very time consuming, yet surprisingly soothing. Each page is hand-marked, cut, and folded, often more than twenty times per page depending on the desired detail. A simple name usually takes around eight hours. Something as complex as a face can take well over thirty hours to finish."
      - text: "Due to interest in my art, I am open to commissions and would happily take on any project you have in mind."
